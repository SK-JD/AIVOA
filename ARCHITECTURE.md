# Architecture — AI-First CRM (Log HCP Interaction)

This document explains how the system is built and **why** each decision was made, so a reviewer
can understand it quickly.

## 1. Overall architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────┐        HTTP/JSON        ┌───────────────────────────────┐
│  React + Redux (Vite)    │  ───────────────────▶   │  FastAPI                      │
│  • Interaction form      │   POST /api/chat        │  • /api/chat  → LangGraph     │
│  • AI Assistant chat     │   GET  /api/hcps        │  • /api/hcps  → directory     │
│  • Admin / Docs          │   /api/admin/*          │  • /api/admin → settings      │
└──────────────────────────┘  ◀───────────────────   └───────────────┬───────────────┘
        ▲   applies form_patch      reply + form_patch                │
        │   to Redux (live form)                                      ▼
        │                                        ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
        └──────────── the form is a live ────────│  LangGraph agent (ReAct loop)      │
                      mirror of the chat          │  agent ⇄ tools → 6 tools           │
                                                  │  LangChain → Groq (gpt-oss-120b)   │
                                                  └───────────────┬────────────────────┘
                                                                  ▼
                                                     PostgreSQL (hcps, interactions,
                                                                 app_settings)
```

**Core idea:** the user never fills the form manually. They talk to the AI Assistant; a **LangGraph
tool-calling agent** understands the message, extracts structured data, reasons about what's
missing, and returns a **`form_patch`** that Redux merges into the form. The form is a *live,
structured mirror* of the conversation.

**Why this shape:** one LLM seam, one graph, a thin stateless API, and a frontend that only renders
state + applies patches. Each layer is independently testable and swappable.

---

## 2. Frontend structure (`frontend/src/`)

| Folder | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `pages/` | `LogInteractionPage` (split view), `AdminPage` (Groq settings), `DocsPage` (in-app guide) |
| `components/` | `InteractionForm`, `ChatAssistant`, field widgets (`HCPNameField`, `MaterialsField`, `SamplesField`, `ChipList`), `Icon` (inline SVG set) |
| `redux/` | `formSlice` (form + `updatedFields` highlight), `chatSlice` (transcript/status), `adminSlice` (settings/token), `store` |
| `hooks/` | `useChat` — the single AI→form update path |
| `services/` | `api.js` — fetch wrapper |
| `utils/` | `constants.js` — form defaults, material catalog, required fields (mirrors backend) |

**Why Redux:** the form and chat are cross-component shared state, and AI updates arrive as partial
patches — a reducer (`applyPatch`) is the natural fit and keeps the form a pure function of events.

## 3. Backend structure (`backend/app/`)

| Folder | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `api/` | FastAPI routes (chat, hcps, admin) |
| `graph/` | `state.py` (AgentState), `engine.py` (`build_graph`, `should_continue`) |
| `nodes/` | `agent_node` (LLM decides), `tool_node` (executes + advances form) |
| `tools/` | the 6 tools + `common.py` (normalization) |
| `services/` | `llm.py` (the only LangChain/Groq seam), `settings_service.py`, `chat_service.py`, `form_logic.py` |
| `prompts/` | `*.txt` prompts + `loader.py` |
| `models/` `schemas/` `database/` `config/` | ORM, Pydantic contracts, session/seed, settings + catalog |

**Why this layout:** it matches the assignment's requested structure and isolates every concern —
the LLM lives behind one module, prompts are files not code, business rules are one module.

---

## 4. LangGraph workflow

The graph is the canonical **ReAct tool-calling loop**:

```
        ┌───────────────── should_continue ─────────────────┐
        │                                                    │
   ─▶ agent ──(last AI msg has tool_calls?)── "tools" ─▶ tools ─┐
        ▲                                                    │   │
        └────────────────────── loop ────────────────────────┘   │
        │                                                        │
        └──── "end" (plain reply) ────▶ END                      │
```

- **entry:** `agent`
- **`agent` → conditional (`should_continue`)** → `tools` if the model asked for a tool, else `END`
- **`tools` → `agent`** (always loops back so the model can react to tool results)
- Compiled **once** at startup; **one HTTP turn = one `graph.invoke`**.

**Why real LangGraph (not a hand-rolled engine):** the assignment mandates LangGraph; the ReAct
loop is its canonical pattern and lets the **LLM choose tools from natural language** — no hardcoded
"if message contains X set field Y" logic. A `recursion_limit` (12) is a safety net; a
`GraphRecursionError` recovers whatever tools already produced instead of failing the turn.

### Graph state (`graph/state.py`)
```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]  # conversation (system+user+AI+tool)
    form: dict                               # live form snapshot, injected into tools
```
`add_messages` appends tool results correctly. `form` is what makes tools *stateful within a turn*.

### Nodes (`nodes/`)
| Node | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `agent_node` | Bind the 6 tools to the LLM and let it decide: call a tool or reply. Retries on a transient Groq `tool_use_failed` with a fallback model. **This is where reasoning lives.** |
| `tool_node` | Wrap LangGraph's `ToolNode` to run the requested tools, then **merge each tool's `form_patch` into `state.form`** so a later tool (e.g. `save`) sees fields an earlier tool (e.g. `log`) just filled. |

**Why only two nodes:** the ReAct pattern needs exactly these two; adding more would be
over-engineering. The *intelligence* is in the agent + tools + prompt, not in extra nodes.

---

## 5. Tool responsibilities (`tools/`)

| Tool | Type | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `log_interaction` | mandatory | LLM-extract **all** structured fields from a free-text description (name, type, date, attendees, topics, materials, samples, sentiment, outcomes, follow-ups). |
| `edit_interaction` | mandatory | Update a **single** field on a correction; appends to list fields. |
| `search_hcp` | custom | Resolve the HCP against the `hcps` directory (DB). |
| `search_materials` | custom | Map a mentioned material to the **catalog type** and add it. |
| `suggest_followups` | custom | LLM-generate next-step follow-up actions. |
| `save_interaction` | custom | **Validate required fields** (HCP Name + Topics) then persist to Postgres; refuses + reports what's missing otherwise. |

**Tool-selection logic:** the LLM picks tools from their **docstrings + the system prompt rules**
(e.g. "call `log_interaction` once", "only `save` when the user asks"). Tools return
`content_and_artifact` — human text for the model, a structured `artifact` (`form_patch`,
`suggestions`, `saved_id`) that the API harvests. Tools that need live form values read them via
`InjectedState("form")`.

---

## 6. AI workflow — how it reasons like a CRM assistant

Each turn, `chat_service` builds a **form-aware system prompt** containing the current form snapshot
and the list of **missing required / recommended** fields. So the agent:

1. **Extracts** on first description (`log_interaction`, once).
2. **Reasons about completeness** — if HCP Name or Topics is still missing, it asks **one specific
   clarifying question** instead of guessing.
3. **Distinguishes Outcomes (what happened) from Follow-ups (what's next)** — enforced in the prompt.
4. **Edits** single fields on corrections (`edit_interaction`), never re-logging.
5. **Validates before saving** — `save_interaction` blocks on missing required fields and the agent
   asks for them.
6. **Replies meaningfully** — confirms captured fields, flags gaps, offers the next step.

**Why prompt-driven, not code-driven:** completeness/clarification is reasoning, not string
matching. Putting the form state + missing fields into the prompt lets the LLM decide — which is the
whole point of an *AI-first* CRM.

## 7. Voice processing

```
Browser MediaRecorder ─▶ POST /api/voice/transcribe (multipart)
   ─▶ Groq Whisper (whisper-large-v3-turbo) ─▶ transcript
   ─▶ transcript flows through the SAME agent (POST /api/chat → log_interaction)
   ─▶ fields populate + AI summary/clarify in chat
Talk-back: assistant reply ─▶ browser SpeechSynthesis (TTS), toggled in the chat header
```

- **STT** — `services/voice.py` calls the Groq SDK's audio endpoint directly (audio isn't part of
  the LangChain chat seam). The "Summarize from Voice Note" button and the chat mic both record via
  `useVoiceInput` (MediaRecorder), POST the blob, then feed the transcript into `useChat.send`.
- **TTS** — `useSpeech` uses the browser's built-in `SpeechSynthesis` (zero dependencies); a speaker
  toggle in the chat header speaks each new assistant reply.

**Why route the transcript through the existing agent:** speech is just another way to produce the
user's text — reusing the graph means the voice path gets extraction, clarifying questions, and
validation for free, with no separate pipeline.

---

## 8. Database schema (`models/models.py`)

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `hcps` | id, name, specialty, organization — the HCP directory (`search_hcp`) |
| `interactions` | id, hcp_name, interaction_type, date, time, attendees (JSON), topics, materials_shared (JSON `[{type,name}]`), samples_distributed (JSON `[{name,quantity}]`), sentiment, outcomes, followup_actions, created_at |
| `app_settings` | key, value — runtime Groq key/model overlay for the Admin panel |

**Why JSON columns for lists:** materials/samples/attendees are small structured lists; JSON keeps
the schema simple (assessment-appropriate) while staying structured. **Why sync SQLAlchemy:** tools
run inside the graph and touch the DB; sync sessions keep tools simple and FastAPI runs the sync
endpoint in a threadpool.

---

## 9. Prompt strategy (`prompts/*.txt`)

| Prompt | Role |
|---|---|
| `system.txt` | **Dynamic** — rendered per turn with the current form + missing fields; defines tool rules and the "reason, don't just map" behavior. |
| `extract.txt` | JSON extraction schema for `log_interaction` (materials/samples object shapes, outcomes≠follow-ups). |
| `followups.txt` | Follow-up suggestion generation. |
| `json_system.txt` | Minimal system prompt for **internal** JSON calls, so the extraction model returns JSON instead of trying to call a tool. |

Prompts are **files, not Python** (mustache-lite `{{var}}`), so behavior is tuned without code
changes and JSON braces don't clash with `str.format`.

---

## 10. State management

- **Backend:** `AgentState` (messages + form) flows through the graph; the API is otherwise
  stateless — the frontend sends the current form snapshot each turn, so `edit`/`save` see live
  values across turns, and `tool_node` advances the form *within* a turn.
- **Frontend:** Redux. `formSlice.applyPatch` merges the AI's `form_patch` and records
  `updatedFields` (for the brief highlight); `chatSlice` holds the transcript; `adminSlice` the
  settings.

---

## 11. API flow (one chat turn)

```
POST /api/chat { message, messages[], form }
  └─ chat_service.run_chat
       ├─ build form-aware system prompt (current form + missing required)
       ├─ graph.invoke({messages, form})           [LangGraph]
       │    agent → (tool_calls?) → tools → agent → … → final reply
       │      • agent_node: LLM + bind_tools        [LangChain → Groq]
       │      • tool_node : run tools, merge form_patch into state.form
       ├─ harvest ToolMessage artifacts → form_patch, suggestions, saved_id
       └─ return { reply, form_patch, suggestions, saved_id, tools_used }
  Frontend: dispatch(applyPatch(form_patch)) → form updates live
```

Errors map cleanly: Groq not configured → **503**; bad admin token → **401**; any turn-level
failure → a safe fallback reply (**never 500 a turn**), logged server-side.

## 12. Testing

- **Backend (pytest, 31 tests):** field normalization/coercion (incl. structured materials/samples),
  required-field logic, all 6 tools (LLM mocked, sqlite DB), graph routing + form-merge, chat-service
  harvesting, settings overlay. Runs against a throwaway SQLite DB — no Postgres/Groq needed.
- **Frontend (Vitest, 5 tests):** `formSlice` reducers (patch merge, material dedupe, samples,
  suggestions).

Run: `cd backend && pytest`  and  `cd frontend && npm test`.
